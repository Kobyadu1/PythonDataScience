# PythonDataScience
This is the code/notes of an online course I did in python that took me over the basics of data anaylsis. I used libraries such as Pandas and Numpy as well as visualization libraries such as MatplotLib and Seaborn. 

I learned how to pull the required data I needed from a dataset, clean that data and transform it into a useable source and then learned how to not only build various types of predictive models (linear to multi polynomial models), but when to best use each type, accounting for over and underfitting of the model.
